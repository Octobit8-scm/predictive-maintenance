## Overview
Predictive maintenance uses data-driven insights to forecast machine failures before they occur, enabling manufacturers to minimize downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and optimize operations.
## Objective: 
Predict machine failures in advance to reduce unplanned downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.
## Data Sources
-	IoT sensor data (e.g., vibration, temperature, pressure).
-	Machine logs.
-	Maintenance history.
-	Environmental factors (e.g., humidity, ambient temperature).
## Implementation Steps
### 1.	Data Collection
-	Collect real-time data from IoT sensors installed on machines.
-	Integrate data from machine logs and maintenance records.
### 2.	Data Preprocessing
-	Clean raw sensor data to remove noise and anomalies.
-	Impute missing values to ensure data consistency.
### 3.	Feature Engineering
-	Create relevant features, such as:
   - Average and peak vibration frequencies.
   - Temperature trends over time.
   - Machine age and usage patterns.
### 4.	Model Development
-	Implement time series forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet for trend analysis.
-	Use machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest or XGBoost for classification and prediction.
### 5.	Deployment
-	Deploy the predictive model into a real-time monitoring system.
-	Trigger maintenance alerts when the model detects potential failures.
### 6.	Monitoring and Maintenance
-	Continuously monitor model performance using metrics like precision and recall.
-	Refine the model with updated data to maintain accuracy over time.
